# Wiki Cards

Exercise using [wikipedia's api](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php) to pull a random article's title, snippet, and link. Displays in 'wiki cards'.

**Uses**:
- JQuery
- Underscore
- HTML/CSS3 (Sass)
- Neat

- Gulp

###Todo
I've started working on a Parse version which will allow users to save cards to their account so they can reference them later.
